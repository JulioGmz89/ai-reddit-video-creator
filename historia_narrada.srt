00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
My  30F,  husbands,  25M

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,560
parents  are  refusing  to

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,560
speak  with  him  after

4
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,720
we  decided  to  hyphenate

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,400
our  last  names.

6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:08,600
Any  advice?

7
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,920
Hello  all,  my  hubby

8
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,660
and  I  got  married

9
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,480
three  weeks  ago.

10
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,300
To  honor  my  grandpa

11
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,340
who  passed  away  a

12
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,260
few  weeks  before  the

13
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,500
wedding,  I  felt  that

14
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:17,880
I  didn't

15
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,560
want  to  lose  my

16
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,200
last  name.

17
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,800
Hubby  and  I  decided

18
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,000
on  a  hyphenated  last

19
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,400
name.

20
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,280
His  parents  found  out

21
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,640
and  are  absolutely  furious

22
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,960
with  him,  and  probably

23
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,780
with  me  too.

24
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,340
We  have  no  idea

25
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,600
what  exactly  they're  furious

26
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,540
about  the  hyphenation,  that

27
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,520
he's  changing  his  last

28
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:33,940
name.

29
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,540
They  won't  talk,  so

30
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,780
I  have  absolutely  no

31
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,000
clue.

32
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:38,720
It's  tearing  up  my

33
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,140
husband  so  much,  and

34
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,300
I  feel  terrible  because

35
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,340
I  didn't  realize  it

36
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,020
would  go  down  like

37
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:43,260
this.

38
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:44,720
But  I  also  feel

39
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,740
like  this  is  a

40
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,520
choice  for  our  new

41
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,860
family  to  make,  the

42
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,920
first  of  many  important

43
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,300
choices,  and  they  must

44
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,000
respect  that.

45
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,500
Just  looking  for  some

46
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,380
advice  on  what  to

47
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,380
do  and  how  to

48
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,300
help  my  husband  through

49
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:55,480
it.
